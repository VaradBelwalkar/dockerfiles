It also contains all the general utilities that appear in normal desktop Ubuntu installtion which do not come with official ubuntu image (like nano, git etc)
You can only authorize a public key by using docker's client to cp the public key into the authorized_keys file in the user provided in the container and use the 
private key for authentication and login to shell 
The login shell is default to BASH
